Description:
OSSP mm is a 2-layer abstraction library which simplifies the usage of
shared memory between forked (and this way strongly related) processes
under Unix platforms. On the first (lower) layer it hides all platform
dependent implementation details (allocation and locking) when dealing
with shared memory segments and on the second (higher) layer it
provides a high-level malloc(3)-style API for a convenient and well
known way to work with data-structures inside those shared memory
segments.
