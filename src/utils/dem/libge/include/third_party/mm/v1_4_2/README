  OSSP mm - Shared Memory Allocation

  Version 1.4.2 (15-Aug-2006)

  OSSP mm is a 2-layer abstraction library which simplifies the usage of
  shared memory between forked (and this way strongly related) processes
  under Unix platforms. On the first (lower) layer it hides all platform
  dependent implementation details (allocation and locking) when dealing
  with shared memory segments and on the second (higher) layer it
  provides a high-level malloc(3)-style API for a convenient and well
  known way to work with data-structures inside those shared memory
  segments.

  This library was successfully tested on FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD,
  BSDI, Linux, SunOS, Solaris, Tru64, AIX, A/UX, HP-UX, ReliantUNIX,
  IRIX, UnixWare and even Win32 Cygwin, BeOS and OS/390.
