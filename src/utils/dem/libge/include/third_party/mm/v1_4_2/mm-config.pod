=head1 NAME

B<mm-config> - OSSP mm library configuration/build utility

=head1 VERSION

OSSP mm MM_VERSION_STR

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<mm-config>
[B<--help>]
[B<--version>]
[B<--cflags>]
[B<--ldflags>]
[B<--libs>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<mm-config> program is a little helper utility for easy configuring and
building applications based on the mm(3) library.  It can be used to query the
C compiler and linker flags which are required to correctly compile and link
the application against the mm(3) library.

=head1 OPTIONS

B<mm-config> accepts the following options:

=over 4

=item B<--help>

Prints the short usage information.

=item B<--version>

Prints the version number and date of the installed mm(3) library.

=item B<--cflags>

Prints the C compiler flags which are needed to compile the mm(3)-based
application. The output is usually added to the C<CFLAGS> variable of the
applications C<Makefile>.

=item B<--ldflags>

Prints the linker flags (C<-L>) which are needed to link the application with
the mm(3) library. The output is usually added to the C<LDFLAGS> variable of
the applications C<Makefile>.

=item B<--libs>

Prints the library flags (C<-l>) which are needed to link the application with
the mm(3) library. The output is usually added to the C<LIBS> variable of the
applications C<Makefile>.
